    I am a second-year MASc (Master of Applied Science) student at the University of Toronto, working under the guidance of <a href="https://janders.eecg.utoronto.ca/">Professor Jason Anderson</a>. CGRAs are a type of reconfigurable device known for their potential to deliver greater performance gains compared to other reconfigurable hardware, such as FPGAs. My current research focuses on developing various CAD mapping algorithms for CGRAs to enable efficient application execution and maximize hardware performance.

    Before starting my master's, I worked as a Silicon Design Engineer at AMD in India. During my undergraduate studies in Electronics, I interned with Prof. Paolo Ienne at EPFL for the <a href="https://dynamatic.epfl.ch/">Dynamatic</a> project, Prof. Kamakoti at IIT Madras on the <a href="https://shakti.org.in/">Shakti</a> project, and participated in the Google Summer of Code with BeagleBoard.org for the <a href="https://beaglewire.github.io/">BeagleWire</a> project. I am always open to research opportunities in Computer Architecture, Reconfigurable Computing, and RTL Design & Verification. Feel free to connect with me if you would like to discuss any ideas or any of my previous work.

    In my free time, I like to play cricket, chess, and watch movies.
