As you are all aware, these TA positions are quite competitive, but if you apply early, you will have a far better chance of getting one.
This page contains information on locating a suitable course for TA and a sample email template to send to professors.

## When to apply:

After professors request TA, the courses will typically appear on some TA job platform ([CUPE LOCAL 3902](http://unit1.hrandequity.utoronto.ca/)). This usually occurs in late July at the University of Toronto. I believe that the longer you wait for this official position to come up, the lower your chances get.

As a result, the best method to apply for TA is to keep an eye out for Courses announcements for undergraduate students in your/other departments. That course catalog can be found on the undergraduate page of the department. In my situation, I discovered from the UofT's ECE undergraduate page, where I could view the timetable of UofT Professors.

## Suitable course:

You can select the appropriate course from the catalog based on your interests. Consider taking a class if you excelled in related undergraduate coursework and have a lot of project experience.

I chose the following course because I did well in a similar undergraduate course and had numerous projects to show the instructor.

<table class="center">
  <tr>
    <th>Session Name</th>
    <th>Dept</th>
    <th>Full Title</th>
    <th>Section</th>
    <th>Start Date</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fall 2023</td>
    <td>ECE</td>
    <td>ECE241H1F: DIGITAL SYSTEMS</td>
    <td>LEC 0101</td>
    <td>2023-09-07</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Also, before sending a cold email, check the course's laboratories to determine what software and experiments they are conducting. I reviewed ECE241's syllabus (l[ink](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/CourseInfo_ECE241_2019.pdf)) and noticed that they use Intel's Quartus prime to simulate digital circuits in FPGA laboratories. I had done many projects related to this, which I mentioned in my cold email, which you can find below.

## Application Procedure:

Apply on the Electrical and Computer Engineering on-line TA Database. Instructions and link are posted on the ECE TA web page: [https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/faculty/career-opportunities/](https://www.ece.utoronto.ca/faculty/career-opportunities/) or directly at TAD platform of the ECE Dept.

## Sample Mail:

*Subject:* Request to be a Teaching Assistant for ECE241H1F: Digital Systems in Fall 2023

``` 
Hi <Prof>,

I hope you are doing well. I had come across the following link here and saw that you were the course Instructor for the “ECE241 Digital System” course for ECE undergraduate students.

| Session Name | Dept | Full Title | Section | Start Date |
| ---------- |:------:| :-----:| :-----:| :-----:|
| Fall 2023 | ECE | ECE241H1F: DIGITAL SYSTEMS | LEC 0101 | 2023-09-07 |

I'm writing to inquire about the possibility of serving as a Teaching Assistant (TA) for the course for the fall semester of 2023. I believe my expertise is well-aligned with the course material.

**What makes me suitable?**

- I earned a score of 10/10 in courses such as "Digital Combinational Circuits" and "Digital Sequential Lab" [[Transcript]](http://omkarbhilare.me/pdf/Omkar_Bhilare_Transcripts.pdf) during my undergraduate studies.
- I observed that in the previous edition of the lab course, we implemented circuits on FPGAs and used Intel's Quartus toolchain. During my many projects and courses, I have used Intel, Xilinx, and Open-source FPGA toolchains extensively.
    - In Summer@EPFL project, we were doing Mixed mode simulation as the dynamatic contained both Verilog and VHDL. [**Done on Quartus, also used Vivado for power, area estimations**.]
    - Undergraduate thesis: Accelerated Deepfake detection on Versal FPGA [[Hackster.io](https://www.hackster.io/thematrix/deepfakes-c-l-i-on-vck5000-f04ca2#toc-2-4-evaluation-12)] [**Vivado, Vitis AI**]
    - Ping Pong game on ICE40Hx FPGA (Beaglewire) [[Github](https://github.com/BeagleWire/BeagleWire/tree/master/examples/vga_pong)] [**Yosys**]
    - 8-Bit-ALU-Implementation-on-CYCLONE-2 [[Github Link](https://github.com/ombhilare999/8-Bit-ALU-implementation-on-CYCLONE-2)] [**Quartus, iVerilog, GTKWAVE**]
    - Seven segments [[Github](https://github.com/ombhilare999/Seven-Segment-with-Tang-Primer-FPGA)] and VGA [[Github](https://github.com/ombhilare999/vga-interface-with-TANG-PRIMER-FPGA)] Driver for Tang Primer FPGA [**TD IDE**]
- I was also a joint-general secretary of a robotics club in my undergraduate college, where I mentored and taught many junior students on topics related to FPGAs, Computer architecture, and digital design. I would love to use that experience here as well.

I am eager to contribute to the undergraduate learning experience while expanding my own knowledge of the subject. Please let me know what you think. Have a nice day!

Regards,

Omkar Bhilare

## Compensation:

As of 01/01/2023, the hourly rate for TAs in undergraduate courses at the University of Toronto was $47.64. For a semester, you will receive approximately $3,500. Therefore, you will typically need to devote approximately 75 hours per semester. (This may vary from department to department)

In some colleges, TA students are also eligible for tuition fee waivers; you can clarify this with your department administrators.

## Side Note:

The course that I applied for was taken by my master's thesis adviser, however, because some courses have multiple instructors, they will need to inform other professors as well. My professor responded positively as follows:

> Great — I’m meeting with the ECE241 instructors Thursday so I’ll let them know we should hire you as a TA.
> 

Now I will apply formally as well when the course TA position will be online near July end.

I hope this was helpful in your search; please let me know if you have any further queries.
