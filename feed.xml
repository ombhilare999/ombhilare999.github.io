Participants get the chance to learn new skills and to gain hands-on experience in their chosen field while collaborating with leading senior scientists.</p> <p>Fellowship recipients will participate into the life of a research unit, typically to help solve problems which are usually part of major research efforts. Often, this will lead to performing challenging programming or design tasks to prove new concepts. Accepted students will receive a living allowance of CHF 1,600.- per month (pro rata to the actual duration) and a refund of travelling costs (2nd class train ticket or low-cost/economy airfare).</p> <h2 id="application-period--process">Application Period &amp; Process:</h2> <p align="center"> <img width="440" height="420" src="/assets/img/2022-03-18-15-42-09.png"/> </p> <ul> <li>The deadline for Summer EPFL 2022 was 1 December, 2021.</li> <li>One needs to give following documents: <ul> <li>CV</li> <li>Official Transcript</li> <li>Letter of Motivation</li> <li>professor preference (Optional But recommended)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Note LORs are not required in the Summer EPFL Program</li> </ul> <h2 id="post-application">Post Application:</h2> <p>Once the Application is done, most people start hearing about interviews for labs in between end december to mid jan.
