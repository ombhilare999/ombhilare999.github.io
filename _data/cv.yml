    - title: Processor Architecture Laboratory (LAP), EPFL
      institution: Summer@EPFL 
      year: June 2022 - August 2022
      description:
        - Designed a framework for Dynamatic (a dynamic HLS compiler) to access external memory using  AXI interconnect <a href="https://www.ombhilare999.github.io/Interconnect-from-scratch-in-chisel/axi?subid1=20240617-1238-1012-8f6a-0c89f1bc0f90">BLOG</a>
        - Developed a custom-built AXI master with burst support and successfully tested it with load-store queues (LSQs) of Dynamatic
        - Added Burst support in a highly dynamic environment of Dynamaitc using special-built BOM (Burst \& Outstanding Manager) modules
        - Dynamatic's memory handling capabilities were substantially expanded by the unit, at a mere 2\% LUT and 4\% FF count increase
